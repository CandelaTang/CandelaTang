### Hello World!
I'm a biology major in Tsinghua University. Tang is my surname, and Candela is the name en español I picked for myself which means candle ✨  <br/>
Nice to meet ya!

*Facts about me*
⏰ I'm studying basic bioinformatics, spanish, and tennis this semester

🌿 Recently I'm reading *The Greek Way* & *Stoner (Chinese ver.)*

🎇 My favorite movie is *Gangster No.1*

😢 I tend to procrastinate on schoolwork

☁️ Cloudy days make me sad for no reason
